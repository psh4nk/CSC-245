PROGRAM 4: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Preston Shankle

The goal of the Dijkstra program is to take in a list of cities with destinations and the distances between them and calculate the shortest paths amongst them.

Different major functions that compose the Graph class that are used to calculate the shortest path in the Dijkstra program are:

	AddVertext 	-- 	adds a vertex to the graph
	AddEdge		--	add an edge or weight between two vertices within the graph
	WeightIs	--	calculates the weight between two graph vertices
	GetToVertices	--	pushes all vertices that connect to a given graph vertex into a queue
	
The process of building the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm is as follows:

	1. Set a start vertex; this will be provided by the user. Set the distance to 0 and mark it as visited.
	2. Determine which vertices connect to the start vertex using the GetToVertices method in the graph class.
	3. Determine which of these connected vertices has the shortest distance.
	4. Save the shortest connected vertex in the start vertex and set the start vertex as the previous vertex.
	5. Print out the vertex along with the distance traveled and the previous vertex.
	6. Repeat the process until all vertices have been visited and marked.

	Given a test file myFile.txt:

	Mars;Jupiter;34400
	Earth;Venus;162
	Saturn;Neptune;38400
	Earth;Mars;339
	Pluto;Sun;367000
	Mars;Neptune;559
	Sun;Neptune;2344
	Pluto;Saturn;3426
	Saturn;Sun;9000

With each line defined as Origin;Destination;Distance, we can easily build a graph out of this using the Dijkstra program. 

Here's the sample output after this myFile.txt is ran in dijkstra.cpp with Pluto chosen as the starting location:

 Please input your starting vertex: Pluto
